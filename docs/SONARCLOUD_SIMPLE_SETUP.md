# SonarCloud Integration - Simple Setup

## What Was Done

Added SonarCloud analysis to your existing `python-publish.yml` workflow.

## The Change

A new `sonarcloud` job was added to `.github/workflows/python-publish.yml` that:
1. Runs when you publish a release (same trigger as PyPI publish)
2. Generates coverage with `tox -e py312`
3. Uploads results to https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=Strangemother_python-hyperway

## Required: Add GitHub Secret

You need to add **ONE** secret to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Strangemother/python-hyperway/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Name: `SONAR_TOKEN`
4. Value: Get from https://sonarcloud.io/account/security (generate a new token)
5. Click **"Add secret"**

## That's It!

The next time you:
- Create a release, OR
- Manually trigger the workflow

The SonarCloud analysis will run automatically and update your dashboard at:
https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=Strangemother_python-hyperway

## Verify Setup

```bash
# View the updated workflow
cat .github/workflows/python-publish.yml

# The workflow now has 3 jobs:
# 1. release-build (builds package)
# 2. pypi-publish (publishes to PyPI)
# 3. sonarcloud (analyzes code coverage) ‚Üê NEW!
```

## Current Coverage

Local tests show:
- 96.38% coverage
- 303 tests passing
- All ready to upload to SonarCloud!

**Note**: All the extra workflow files and documentation were removed. You now have a simple, integrated solution!

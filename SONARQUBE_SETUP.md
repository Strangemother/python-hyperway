# SonarQube Setup for python-hyperway

## Overview

This project is configured for SonarQube code coverage and analysis with the following setup:

## Files Added/Modified

### 1. `tox.ini` - Test Automation and Coverage
- Configures tox to run tests across Python 3.8-3.12
- Generates XML coverage report for SonarQube at `coverage.xml`
- Enables branch coverage analysis
- Uses relative file paths for better portability

### 2. `sonar-project.properties` - SonarQube Configuration
- Project identification and metadata
- Source/test directory configuration
- Coverage report path configuration
- Exclusions for non-source directories

### 3. `pyproject.toml` - Added tox to dev dependencies
- Added `tox` to `[project.optional-dependencies]`

### 4. `README.md` - Development Section
- Added comprehensive "Development" section
- Includes testing instructions
- Documents tox configuration
- Explains SonarQube integration

## Quick Start

### Generate Coverage Report

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tox to generate coverage
tox

# Or for a specific Python version
tox -e py312
```

This will:
1. Run all tests with pytest
2. Generate `coverage.xml` in the project root
3. Display coverage report in terminal

### Current Coverage

Latest run shows **96.38% coverage** with:
- 745 statements
- 721 covered
- 166 branches
- 163 branches covered (98.2% branch coverage)

### SonarQube Integration

The `coverage.xml` file is in Cobertura format, which SonarQube natively supports.

#### For Local Analysis:
```bash
# Generate coverage
tox

# Run sonar-scanner (requires installation)
sonar-scanner
```

#### For CI/CD:
The coverage.xml will be automatically picked up by SonarQube when:
1. The sonar-scanner runs in your CI/CD pipeline
2. The `sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.xml` property is set (already configured)

### Configuration Details

#### Tox Environment
- `envlist`: py38, py39, py310, py311, py312
- `skip_missing_interpreters = true`: Skips versions not installed
- Coverage includes branch analysis (`--cov-branch`)

#### Coverage Settings
- Source: `src/hyperway`
- Omits: test files and Python cache
- Precision: 2 decimal places
- Shows missing lines in reports

#### SonarQube Properties
- Project Key: `python-hyperway`
- Project Name: `Python Hyperway`
- Sources: `src`
- Tests: `tests`
- Exclusions: Generated files, docs, test files, virtual environments

## Files Generated

When you run `tox`, these files are created:
- `coverage.xml` - Cobertura format coverage report (commit this if needed)
- `.tox/` - Virtual environments for each Python version (don't commit)
- `.coverage` - Coverage data file (don't commit)

## Troubleshooting

### Only one Python version available
Set `skip_missing_interpreters = true` in `tox.ini` (already done) to allow tox to run with only available Python versions.

### Coverage not showing in SonarQube
1. Verify `coverage.xml` exists in project root
2. Check `sonar-project.properties` has correct path
3. Ensure sonar-scanner runs after `tox`
4. Check SonarQube project settings for Python plugin

### Coverage paths incorrect
The `relative_files = True` setting in tox.ini ensures paths are relative, making the coverage report portable across different environments.

## GitHub Actions Integration

GitHub workflows have been created for automated SonarQube/SonarCloud integration:

### Available Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml`** - For SonarCloud (recommended for open source)
2. **`.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml`** - For self-hosted SonarQube

### Quick Setup

See detailed instructions in `.github/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SETUP.md`

**For SonarCloud (recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Sign up at sonarcloud.io with GitHub
# 2. Select python-hyperway repository
# 3. Add SONAR_TOKEN to GitHub Secrets
# 4. Update workflow with your organization name
# 5. Remove the unused sonarqube.yml workflow
# 6. Push to trigger the workflow
```

**For SonarQube:**
```bash
# 1. Set up SonarQube server
# 2. Add SONAR_TOKEN and SONAR_HOST_URL to GitHub Secrets
# 3. Remove the unused sonarcloud.yml workflow
# 4. Push to trigger the workflow
```

### Workflow Features

Both workflows automatically:
- âœ… Run on push to main and pull requests
- âœ… Set up Python 3.12
- âœ… Install tox
- âœ… Generate coverage report
- âœ… Upload to SonarQube/SonarCloud
- âœ… Verify coverage file exists

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Tox configuration is complete and tested
2. âœ… Coverage XML generation is working
3. âœ… SonarQube properties file is created
4. âœ… Documentation is updated
5. âœ… GitHub workflows created for CI/CD
6. ðŸ”² Choose SonarCloud or SonarQube
7. ðŸ”² Set up secrets in GitHub repository
8. ðŸ”² Enable the appropriate workflow
9. ðŸ”² Add SonarQube/SonarCloud badge to README (optional)
